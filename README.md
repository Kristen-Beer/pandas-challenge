Module 4 Challenge
my code is in the pandas-challenge\PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb

The PyCitySchools data set shows that, of the fifteen schools which were either District or Charter schools, 
the top 5 performing schools were all Charter schools with fewer students and a smaller per student budget 
while the bottom 5 performing schools were all District schools with more students and larger per student budgets. 
The data suggests that Charter schools make better use of their budgets when compared with District schools 
using student academic performance metrics.
