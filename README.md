Module 4 Challenge
The PyCitySchools data set shows that, of the fifteen schools which were either District or Charter schools, the top 5 performing schools were all Charter schools with fewer students and a smaller per student budget while the bottom 5 performing schools were all District school with more students and larger per student budgets. The data suggests that Charter schools make better use of their budgets when compared with District schools using student academic performance metrics.
